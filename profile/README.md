## 🌍 What is Planet IX?

Planet IX is a strategy-based NFT game where players collect land tiles (PIX), build infrastructure, form territories, and restore the planet. Based on real-world satellite data and geolocation, each land tile is a tradable NFT. Players earn IXT tokens by developing clusters, deploying facilities, and participating in missions.

The game blends DeFi, real estate simulation, and environmental storytelling — all powered by Web3.
